# App Summary
1. Typical Pomodoro Timer with 3 different timer modes. 
2. Provides a simple "Task" list at the bottom that can be selected or marked as "completed". 
3. Simple dark / light theme mode swapping.
4. Timers can be adjusted accordingly. 

#### Why do this?
1. I wanted a Pomodoro timer app with note taking functionalities. 
2. There were many websites that provided the same functionality but a lot of them were behind paywalls or had limitations. 
3. To get better at FE development.
